# Waiter Client

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and styled with TailwindCSS.

This is the complement of the [Waiter Mobile App](https://github.com/cristhiandcl/waiter-app), [here](https://waiter-client.netlify.app/) you can see the restaurant's orders to be prepared and also interact with them ( has a preparing and dispatch state ). Go to the waiter app if you want to see a demo, and don't hesitate to email me (carrillocristhian2408@gmail.com) if you want a trial.
